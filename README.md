# Simple Cookie Consent GTM

This plugin is a simple solution for GDPR compliance.

Built on the cookie consent plugin by [insites.com](https://cookieconsent.insites.com), this plugin allows the user to select the types of cookies they want enabled. Using GTM, the site administrator can enable exceptions to prevent stuff like Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics etc from firing if the user doesn't want them to.

**This plugin requires the site administrator to enable the exceptions correctly, otherwise the website is not GDPR compliant**
