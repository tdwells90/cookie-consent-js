# Simple Cookie Consent GTM

This WordPress plugin is a simple solution for GDPR compliance, working in tandem with Google Tag Manager exceptions.

Built on the javascript cookie consent plugin by [insites.com](https://cookieconsent.insites.com), this plugin allows the user to select the types of cookies they want enabled. Using GTM, the site administrator can enable exceptions to prevent stuff like Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics etc from firing if the user doesn't want them to.

This plugin **does not** help create a privacy policy. This plugin is just for handling cookies and exceptions _specifically_ within GTM.

**This plugin requires the site administrator to enable the exceptions correctly, otherwise the website is not GDPR compliant**
